# DailyDose

**DailyDose** is an iOS application designed to deliver daily snippets of historical events, anniversaries, and notable occurrences, helping users stay informed and entertained. The idea behind DailyDose is to provide a quick and easy way for users to connect with history and learn something new each day.

## Features

- **Daily Content**: Users receive daily updates featuring events from history, anniversaries, and other significant occurrences relevant to the current date.
- **Historical Event Integration**: The app organizes and presents historical data in an engaging format.
- **Smooth User Experience**: Built with Swift, DailyDose is optimized for iOS, ensuring a fast and responsive interface.
- **Clean and Simple UI**: The app focuses on providing information in a user-friendly and accessible manner, with an emphasis on clarity and ease of use.

## Implementation Details

The DailyDose app is implemented using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architectural pattern, which helps in maintaining a clear separation between the user interface and the business logic:

- **Model**: Represents the data and the business logic. In DailyDose, this includes the historical data and any related processing logic.
  
- **View**: The user interface of the application, responsible for displaying the data to the user. The view layer in DailyDose is designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, providing users with an intuitive experience.
  
- **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, handling the logic for fetching, preparing, and managing the data that will be displayed in the View. It ensures that the data is presented in a format that is easy to consume by the View.

The MVVM architecture allows for better testability and maintainability of the codebase, making it easier to manage and scale the application as new features are added.
